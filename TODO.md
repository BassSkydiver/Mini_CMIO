## Todo:
1. Redo the entire project with good schematic and PCB design practices!
2. Design case with support for a 40mm fan, 10-32 mounting screws, and a power switch.
3. Add dedicated Ethernet.
4. Expand USB selection to Dual USB-A, and USB-C with data.
5. Add small, dedicated GPIO pins with 5V, 3V3, 1V8, and GND pins.
6. Power over Ethernet
7. Probe Points for debugging
8. 3.5 mm audio jack via GPIO pins 40/45 (as seen [here](https://www.hasseb.fi/pi/schematics.pdf))
9. Re-add 0 ohm resistors from Raspberry Pi Foundantion schematics
